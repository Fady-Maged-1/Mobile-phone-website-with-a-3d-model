Project Overview

This project is a Mobile Recommendation Website designed to help users choose the most suitable smartphone based on different categories and preferences. The website provides an organized interface where mobile brands (such as Samsung, Apple, Xiaomi, etc.) are displayed, and users can navigate to view the available models under each brand. Each phone entry contains key details like specifications and features, making it easier for users to explore and compare devices.

One of the highlights of this project is the integration of a 3D Model that allows users to interact with and visualize a sample mobile phone design. This adds an interactive layer to the browsing experience and demonstrates how 3D assets can be embedded within a website for better user engagement.

The project is built using PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript along with **HTML/CSS** for the front-end design. The backend ensures that all phone categories and models are dynamically fetched from the database, making the website easily extendable. For instance, new brands or devices can be added directly to the database without modifying the main code structure.

The purpose of the project is not only to demonstrate technical skills in **web development and database integration** but also to showcase how data-driven content and interactive elements (like 3D models) can enhance the usability and presentation of information on the web.



 Features

* Categorized listing of mobile brands and models.
* Dynamic database-driven content using PHP and MySQL.
* Integration of a 3D interactive model** of a phone.
* Simple, user-friendly navigation and responsive layout.
* Easily extendable: add new brands and models via the database.



 Installation & Setup

1. Download the project and place it inside your local server directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
2. Import the database:

   * Open `phpMyAdmin`.
   * Create a new database (e.g., `mobiles`).
   * Import the provided SQL file.
3. **Configure database connection**:

   * Open the PHP configuration file (e.g., `config.php`).
   * Update database name, username, and password according to your local server.
4. Run the project:

   * Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP.
   * Open your browser and go to:

     ```
     http://localhost/project-folder
     ```
5. You should now see the home page with mobile brands and can explore models dynamically.



âœ… With these steps, the project should run smoothly on your local machine. The demo video can showcase navigation, database-driven pages, and the 3D model interaction.
